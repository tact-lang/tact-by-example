# If Statements

Tact supports if statements in a similar syntax to most programming languages that you're used to. Curly braces are required though, so you can't leave them out.

The condition of the statement can be any boolean expression.

There is no `switch` statement in Tact. If you need to handle a group of outcomes separately, follow the `else if` patten you can see in the third example.
